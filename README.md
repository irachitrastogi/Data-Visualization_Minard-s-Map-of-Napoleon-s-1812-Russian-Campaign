# CHARLES JOSEPH MINARD MAP OF NAPOLEON RUSSIA CAMPAIGN


- This is the 2nd Historical Data Visualization where I have used the same library as used in the 1st i.e. D3.js. Along with this, I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- The data are stores in js which is then accessed by the HTML page and process in another JavaScript.
- This visualization also represents temperate at the time of retreat. This information is also stored in JS with info about longitude, temperature and date.
- The information used for the creation of this graph are latitude, longitude size of the army, that are grouped into three different groups.
- Finally, CSS is used for the purpose of styling.
- Additionally, a mouse hover in this also represents the troop size during the
journey.

   This can be viewed by going to the following link:

How to run the code:

- To run the code locally, Download XAMPP (free and open-source cross-platform web server) and place all the files at the root of the folder. To download XAMPP : https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html - vist the link
- You can check from the settings folder the port to which the local host I assigned to.
                                  For me, it was: http://localhost:8080/minard.html
- Ultimately you will have your local setup ready.
- We can also follow the same steps to run it on any server (AWS or Firebase), just make sure that it has any application to publish your work as XAMPP.
